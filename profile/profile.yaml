# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am graduate from Seneca's software development degree program which equipped me with a variety of skills which I've been able to apply in the real world. I have previously worked for the Ontario government (MPBSD) as a developer and DevOps specialist, leveraging my skills in full-stack, python data analytics and navigating cloud computing technologies to find cost-saving strategies or create meaningful solutions across multiple teams. I have a strong background in leadership through my time at Canada Bread, leading a team of 15 individuals when needed and providing key performance metrics to plan ahead for days. I previously developed a microservice in AWS leveraging S3 buckets for storage, EC2 for scalability, cognito for authentication, and docker for deployment. I am an unrelentingly optimistic developer with a proven experience in a broad spectrum of development such as fullstack development and data analysis with a high regard for communication, teamwork, and delivering efficient solutions in collaborative environments.
