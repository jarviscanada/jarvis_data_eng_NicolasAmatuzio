      "description": "Developed a microservice allowing users to upload and convert various file types to others, providing a secure file management system through AWS infrastructure. Ensured security by normalizing HTML code in files to prevent injection attacks. Deployed an AWS EC2 instance for the reliability and scalability of final production workloads. Implemented AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization for secure access control. Utilized AWS S3 Buckets for data storage on user accounts, ensuring data integrity by following common best practices such as access control and encryption. Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest to ensure functionality and code quality, maintaining a 95%+ test coverage. Maintained code quality by implementing ESLint for linting and enforcing code quality across my codebase. Developed a Docker file to containerize the codebase to ensure no issues were encountered when deploying the microservice. Set up GitHub actions to create a CI/CD pipeline that would automatically install requirements, run unit and integration tests, and deploy the Docker image to Docker Hub for deployment on an EC2 instance",

      "description": "Worked with the Webgl rendering engine 3js to create a vibrant, dynamic background for my website. Created animations that play off a ray cast mouse click to allow users to interact with the background through the 3d objects. Developed interactive components such as a card component for the 'flat' portions of the site to give browsing the site a better feel. Created a secret phrase bar that allows users to edit certain aspects of the site to provide a more fun user experience in allowing users to guess what possible phrases there could be. Developed multiple shaders for objects that can be dynamically updated through the secret phrase bar. Adhered to common web development principles to make the  site easier to look at and read, especially on mobile devices",

It utilizes persistent databases in order to preserve disk, cpu, and memory information from the user agent for higher level users to manage. Testing was done using regex playgrounds and bash -x to properly check outputs and variables during runtime. Deployment was done through GitHub and the postgres docker container for the database.",
