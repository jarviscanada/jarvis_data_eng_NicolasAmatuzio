# Nicolas Amatuzio . Jarvis Consulting

A Graduate from Seneca's software development degree program which equipped me with a variety of skills which I've been able to apply in the real world. Worked for the provincial government (MPBSD DevOps) as a DevOps developer, leveraging my skills in python data analytics and navigating cloud computing technologies to find cost-saving strategies or create meaningful solutions across multiple teams. Provided technical and operational support to supervisors at Canada bread, leading a team of 15 individuals when needed and providing key performance metrics to plan ahead for days. Previously developed a microservice in AWS leveraging S3 buckets for storage, EC2 for scalability, cognito for authentication, and docker for deployment. Proven experience in a broad spectrum of development such as fullstack development and data analysis with a high regard for communication, teamwork, and delivering efficient solutions in collaborative environments.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a monitoring agent to collect VM usage metrics and store it inside of a PSQL database. Utilized persistent databases in order to preserve disk, cpu, and memory information from the user agent for higher level users to manage. Deployed through GitHub and the postgres docker container for the database.

**Java Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Developed a simple grep application in java leveraging lambda functions and streams to enable functionalities in a low memory environment. Implemented recursive search for searching entire directories and enabled users to set a custom output directory. Built with Maven, utilized log4j to log errors and debug info, and containerized using docker, with the image being uploaded to docker hub.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio/tree/master/python_data_wrangling)]: Developed a proof of concept for a UK-based wholesaler, London Gift Shop (LGS). Leveraged Jupyter Notebook was used for data exploration, Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplolib for data wrangling and visualization, and leveraging common analytical techniques like RFM to create data insights into customer behaviour.


## Highlighted Projects
**Fragments Microservice** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Namatuzio/fragments)]: Developed a microservice allowing users to upload and convert various file types to others using AWS infrastructure. Ensured security by normalizing HTML code in files to prevent injection attacks. Deployed an AWS EC2 instance for the reliability and scalability of final production workloads. Implemented AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization for secure access control. Utilized AWS S3 Buckets for data storage on user accounts, ensuring data integrity by following common best practices such as access control and encryption. Wrote comprehensive unit tests in jest to achieve a 95%+ codebase coverage. Leveraged ESLint to maintain code quality and normalization. Wrote a dockerfile to containerize fragments and uploaded the image to docker hub for easy CI/CD integration. Set up a CI/CD pipeline through GitHub actions to run necessary tests and deploy the app on an EC2 instance.

**Personal Website** [[GitHub](https://namatuzio.github.io/)]: Worked with the Webgl rendering engine 3js to create a vibrant, dynamic background for my website. Created animations that play off a ray cast mouse click to allow users to interact with the background through the 3d objects. Developed interactive components such as a card component for the 'flat' portions of the site to give browsing the site a better feel. Created a secret phrase bar that allows users to edit certain aspects of the site to provide a more fun user experience in allowing users to guess what possible phrases there could be. Developed multiple shaders for objects that can be dynamically updated through the secret phrase bar. Adhered to common web development principles to make the  site easier to look at and read, especially on mobile devices
