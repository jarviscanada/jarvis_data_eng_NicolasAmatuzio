# Nicolas Amatuzio . Jarvis Consulting

Hey hey people, I'm Nicolas Amatuzio! I'm a graduate from Seneca's Bachelor of Software Development degree program and have experience in a broad spectrum of development such as fullstack development (Node, React, JS), web security (pen testing, OWASP guidelines), and data analysis (pandas, jupiter notebooks, Power BI). I've previously worked for the municipal government as a devops intern and learned a lot about navigating cloud computing technologies, whether it be cost-saving strategies or the ins-and-outs of services provided by different cloud computing solutions!

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasAmatuzio/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Linux cluster monitoring agent is designed to scrape hardware information to provide easily digestible usage and hardware metrics for easy data parsing from multiple VMs at once. It utilizes persistent databases in order to preserve disk, cpu, and memory information from the user agent for higher level users to manage. Testing was done using regex playgrounds and bash -x to properly check outputs and variables during runtime. Deployment was done through GitHub and the postgres docker container for the database.


## Highlighted Projects
**Fragments Microservice** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Namatuzio/fragments)]: Developed a microservice allowing users to upload and convert various file types to others, providing a secure file management system through AWS infrastructure. Ensured security by normalizing HTML code in files to prevent injection attacks. Deployed an AWS EC2 instance for the reliability and scalability of final production workloads. Implemented AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization for secure access control. Utilized AWS S3 Buckets for data storage on user accounts, ensuring data integrity by following common best practices such as access control and encryption. Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest to ensure functionality and code quality, maintaining a 95%+ test coverage. Maintained code quality by implementing ESLint for linting and enforcing code quality across my codebase. Developed a Docker file to containerize the codebase to ensure no issues were encountered when deploying the microservice. Set up GitHub actions to create a CI/CD pipeline that would automatically install requirements, run unit and integration tests, and deploy the Docker image to Docker Hub for deployment on an EC2 instance

**Personal Website** [[GitHub](https://namatuzio.github.io/)]: Worked with the Webgl rendering engine 3js to create a vibrant, dynamic background for my website. Created animations that play off a ray cast mouse click to allow users to interact with the background through the 3d objects. Developed interactive components such as a card component for the 'flat' portions of the site to give browsing the site a better feel. Created a secret phrase bar that allows users to edit certain aspects of the site to provide a more fun user experience in allowing users to guess what possible phrases there could be. Developed multiple shaders for objects that can be dynamically updated through the secret phrase bar. Adhered to common web development principles to make the  site easier to look at and read, especially on mobile devices
